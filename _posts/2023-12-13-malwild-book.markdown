﷽

Hello, cybersecurity enthusiasts and white hackers!

![book](/assets/images/113/2023-12-13_11-49.png){:class="img-responsive"}    

Alhamdulillah, I finished writing this book today. It was quite difficult. In sha Allah everything will be fine. O Allah, Lord of the Worlds, give strength to all children who are fighting for their lives.        

Why is the book called that? **MALWILD** - means **M**alware in the **W**ild.    

I will be very happy if this book helps at least one person to gain knowledge and learn the science of cybersecurity. The book is mostly practice oriented.

This book is dedicated to my wife, Laura, and my children, Yerzhan and Munira. Also, thanks to everyone who is helping me through these difficult times. The proceeds from the sale of this book will be used to treat my friends:

The book is divided into three logical chapters:
- Malware dev tricks from source code leaks    
- Malware analysis examples    
- Helper scripts (most in python) for malware analysis    

All material in the book is based on my posts from
[WebSec blog](https://wsec-dev.websec.nl/blog), [HVCK magazine](https://hvck-magazine.github.io/), [MSSP Lab blog](https://mssplab.github.io/) and [my](https://cocomelonc.github.io/) own articles.
